# Node JS

## There is a lot to learn and you might get overwhelmed by it if you don't love what you learn

### This repository is beginner-friendly as I have tried to explain the code as much as I can 
### The code doesn't look neat because I wanted to explain how I understood so that you someone new might take some time and understand


## Nothing is easy, consistency is the key
